Remote sensors could be divided into two types as follow:\n\nPassive sensors systems: receive reflected energy\nActive sensors systems: emit electromagnetic waves, such as SAR\n\n\n\n2.1.3 Electromagnetic waves\nThe electromagnetic waves are used by remote sensors to detect and measure physical phenomena, also the carriers of information.\nThe basic properties of electromagnetic waves include wave length(\\(\\lambda\\)), velocity( \\(c\\),rate of oscillation), frequency(\\(v = 3\\times10^8 m/s\\)). They follow the relationship that \\(\\lambda = c/v\\).\n\n2.1.3.1 Related jargon\nThere are also some jargon about electromagnetic waves we need to know:\n\nElectromagnetic radiation(EMR): waves of an electromagnetic field, travel through space and carry radiant\nradiant energy: energy carried by EMR waves\nradiant flux: energy per unit of time\nshortwave radiation: energy from the sun\nsolar irradiacne: energy or solar power from the sun per unit area per unit time\nexitance/emmittance: energy leaving a surface per unit per unit time\n\n\n\n2.1.3.2 Interactions with Earth\n\nsurface\nBRDF\nPolarization\nFluorensence\natmospheric\nRayleigh\nMie\nNon selective\n\n\n\n\n2.1.4 Remote Sensing Data\n\n2.1.4.1 Data formats\n\n\n2.1.4.2 Four resolutions\nSpatial Resolution\nSpectral Resolution\nRadiometric Resolution\nTemporal Resolution"
